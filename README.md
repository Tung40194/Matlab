A water-fall Counter simulation with matlab.
Matlab version 2018 and above

- This simulation is not realtime due to Matlab's computation limitation.

- Each number's show in matlab will depend on computer's computation capability but will happen in 0.25 seconds in realtime given g = 0.98.

- This can be used to create a real water-fall clock.
